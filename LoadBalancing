Why Load Balancer?

1) Using a LB will make the application avaialbe all the time (H.A) and prevents request load on a single server
2) Api response times are faster, since there is less load on each server
3) it provides the system to remove the servers which make our system fault tolerance

How a LB identifies fault tolerance in a server ?

1) Health Checks
    a) Active health checks: LB sends request to the server and marks it unhealty if it does not provide any response backa and do not send furthur requests to it
    b) Passive health checks: LB monitors if the response from the server has any errors, if so, LB marks it as unhealthy and will not send furthur requests to it.

2) Monitor CPU Utilization:
    if a server is running out of CPU, memory or diskspace. it is more likely to go down, LB detects these kind of activity and marks it as unhealthy

3) Heartbeat Signals:
    `Servers can send a heartbeat signal to LB to indicate they are alive, if LB does not receive a signal, it gonna mark it as unhealthy
